A great inspiration for me
to discover and create something which can help make people's lives easier.
! As a creative, collaborative thinker with a desire to learn;
I would enjoy working in an agile development environment
+ where I can bring my own ideas; able to work across a 
wide variety of tasks to further develop my knowledge
+ in a team that has the freedom and responsibility to make decisions.
