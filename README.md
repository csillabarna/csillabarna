I have always been deeply curious about how the world works
and what makes things tick!
It was this curiosity, paired with an analytical mindset and persistence 
which led me to pivot my career to programming.
My experience working in hospitality environment required
efficient team collaboration, proactivity and performing under pressure, 
could also help my transition into software development.

A great inspiration for me
to discover and create something which can help make people's lives easier.
! As a creative, collaborative thinker with a desire to learn;
I would enjoy working in an agile development environment
+ where I can bring my own ideas; able to work across a 
wide variety of tasks to further develop my knowledge
+ in a team that has the freedom and responsibility to make decisions.
